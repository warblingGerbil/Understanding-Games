    To best understand games, let's first take a brief look at how people function and the games we play
    within this overall, greater "game" of life.
    The human mind wants to have a purpose. It wants to achieve through work. Games help meet that desire.
    The set goal gives the person a purpose. Where a person might otherwise be bored, it provides a challenge to work on.
    Whether through luck, skill, or strategy, a good game requires the players to put effort into it.
    A person wants to win, but we also want to earn it.

    Some might ask, "Why make up a problem when you can be productive and solve real ones?" And it's a real question.
    Why should we waste time creating problems instead of trying to solve existing ones?
    Games train your mind, and in the case of sports, your body as well, to think and perform on a higher level.
    Games can improve memory, fitness, and quick thinking.

    Problems in real life can be overwhelming, and sometimes we just want to escape. Games give us that escape and give us smaller problems to handle.
    Imagine a game that was just like life: eat, work, school, chores. Would you play it? Probably not.
    Games twist reality with new rules and let us imagine beyond the ordinary.

    A game is entertainment, but it is also an escape and a training ground.
    It challenges us in ways real life often cannot, and it prepares us to return to life with renewed strength.

    Returning to the original question—what does this mean games are as a whole?
    A game is a world with rules, goals, and challenges. Life mirrors this structure.
    We have boundaries set by God, a purpose to fulfill, and a goal to pursue.
    The game of life is vast, difficult, and meaningful. We have the tools to win, but we must choose how to play.
    With our minds set on Christ, the goal ahead, we play to win.
