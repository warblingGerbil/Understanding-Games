  <h1>Understanding Games</h1>
  <h2>Just what makes a game, giving it the life that inspires us to play them?</h2>

  <p>
    We play many games throughout our lives, bringing a spark of fun to our day, but what gives them this appeal?
    Games play deeply off of our very human natures, and their definition is not quite as simple as it might first seem.
    We have board games, card games, video games, and sports, but what do they all have in common that makes them what they are?

  <p>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game">Wikipedia</a> defines a game as a structured play often undertaken for entertainment or fun.
    <a href="https://getcreativetoday.com/define-game/">Getcreativetoday</a> notes that games all have a goal and change according to player interaction following certain rules.
    So that's what a game is. But why?
    <a href="https://www.idtech.com/blog/what-makes-video-games-fun">ID Tech</a> phrases it quite well like this:
    “games allow players to take on the role of someone new and different, in worlds they’d never have the chance to explore,
    in situations beyond what the mind could ever fathom.”
