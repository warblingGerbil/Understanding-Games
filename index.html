  <h1>Understanding Games</h1>
  <h2>Just what makes a game, giving it the life that inspires us to play them?</h2>

  <p>
    We play many games throughout our lives, bringing a spark of fun to our day, but what gives them this appeal?
    Games play deeply off of our very human natures, and their definition is not quite as simple as it might first seem.
    We have board games, card games, video games, and sports, but what do they all have in common that makes them what they are?
