  <h1>A World of Games</h1>
  <h2>Just what makes a game, giving it the life that inspires us to play them?</h2>

  <p>
    We play many games throughout our lives, bringing a spark of fun to our day, but have you ever wondered just what they are?
    Is it a just a way to test ourselves? Is it purely for entertainment? Or... is it something more?
    Games play deeply off of our very human natures, and their definition is not quite as simple as it might first seem.
    We have board games, card games, video games, and sports. Even life itself is a often called a game. The most dangerous
    game. So what do they all have in common that makes them what they are?

    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game">Wikipedia</a> defines a game as a structured play often undertaken for entertainment or fun.
    <a href="https://getcreativetoday.com/define-game/">Getcreativetoday</a> notes that games all have a goal and change according to player interaction following certain rules.
    So that's what a game is. But why?
    <a href="https://www.idtech.com/blog/what-makes-video-games-fun">ID Tech</a> phrases it quite well like this:
    “games allow players to take on the role of someone new and different, in worlds they’d never have the chance to explore,
    in situations beyond what the mind could ever fathom.”
  </p>

  <p>
    To best understand games, let's first take a brief look at how people function and the games we play
    within this overall, greater \"game\" of life.
    
    The human mind wants to have a purpose. It wants to achieve through work. Games help meet that desire.
    The set goal gives the person a purpose. Where a person might otherwise be bored, it provides a challenge to work on.
    Whether through luck, skill, or strategy, a good game requires the players to put effort into it.
    A person wants to win, but we also want to earn it. The work put into a game makes achieving the goal more valuable to the player.
  </p>

  <p>
    Some might ask, "Why make up a problem when you can be productive and solve real ones?" And it's a real question.
    Why should we waste time creating problems instead of trying to solve existing ones? First, I would argue that to play a game is not necessarily unproductive.
    Games train your mind, and in the case of sports, your body as well, to think and perform on a higher level.
    It gives you a problem you can handle, and your muscles, whether mental or physical, practice finding ways to solve it.
    Games can improve memory, fitness, and quick thinking.
  </p>

  <p>
    Problems in real life can be overwhelming, and sometimes we just want to escape. Games give us that escape and give us smaller problems to handle.
    There is a reason no game is perfectly like life. Yes, technology still limits us so that it is not yet fully possible.
    But imagine a game that was just like life. You have to eat, work, go to school, and every menial, dry task we face in real life.
    Would you play it? Why not? It's because a game is an escape. Games put a twist on reality with a new set of rules.
    They let us use our imagination to go beyond the confines of reality. In games, we are not living our own life — but escaping to another world.
  </p>

  <p>
    A game is an activity for entertainment. It is also an escape. But it is so much more as well.
    A good game is one where you can immerse yourself in with a goal away from the problems of this world,
    challenging yourself in a more direct, immediate, and attainable manner than normal life provides.
    In turn, the game becomes both an escape and a mental and/or physical training ground.
    It offers our minds a break from a tough world, keeps us sharp, and then lets us return back to our lives with a new vigor,
    ready to face the challenges in real life.
