  The human mind wants to have a purpose. It wants to achieve through work. Games help meet that desire. 
  The set goal gives the person a purpose. Where a person might otherwise be bored, it provides a challenge 
  to work on. Whether through luck, skill, or strategy, a good game requires the players to put effort into it. 
  A person wants to win, but we also want to earn it. The work put into a game makes achieving the goal more 
  valuable to the player.

  Some might ask, "Why make up a problem when you can be productive and solve real ones?" And it's a real 
  question. Why should we waste time creating problems instead of trying to solve existing ones? First, I would 
  argue that to play a game is not necessarily unproductive. Games train your mind, and in the case of sports, 
  your body as well, to think and perform on a higher level. It gives you a problem you can handle, and your 
  muscles, whether mental or physical, practice finding ways to solve it. Games can improve memory, fitness, 
  and quick thinking.

  Problems in real life can be overwhelming, and sometimes we just want to escape. Games give us that escape 
  and give us smaller problems to handle. There is a reason no game is perfectly like life. Yes, technology 
  still limits us so that it is not yet fully possible. But imagine a game that was just like life. You have to 
  eat, work, go to school, and every menial, dry task we face in real life. Would you play it? Why not? It's 
  because a game is an escape. Games put a twist on reality with a new set of rules. They let us use our 
  imagination to go beyond the confines of reality. In games, we are not living our own life — but escaping 
  to another world.

  A game is an activity for entertainment. But it is so much more as well. A good game is one where you can 
  immerse yourself in with a goal away from the problems of life, challenging yourself in a more direct, 
  immediate, and attainable manner than normal life provides. In turn, the game becomes both an escape and 
  a mental and/or physical training ground. It offers our minds a break from a tough world, keeps us sharp, 
  and then lets us return back to our lives with a new vigor, ready to face the challenges in real life.
