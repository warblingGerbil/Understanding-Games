  </p>

  <p>
    We play many games throughout our lives, bringing a spark of fun to our day, but have you ever wondered just what they are?
    Is it a just a way to test ourselves? Is it purely for entertainment? Or... is it something more?
    Games play deeply off of our very human natures, and their definition is not quite as simple as it might first seem.
    We have board games, card games, video games, and sports. Even life itself is often called a game.

    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game">Wikipedia</a> defines a game as a structured play often undertaken for entertainment or fun.
    <a href="https://getcreativetoday.com/define-game/">Getcreativetoday</a> notes that games all have a goal and change according to player interaction following certain rules.
    So that's what a game is. But why?
    <a href="https://www.idtech.com/blog/what-makes-video-games-fun">ID Tech</a> phrases it quite well like this:
    “games allow players to take on the role of someone new and different, in worlds they’d never have the chance to explore,
    in situations beyond what the mind could ever fathom.”
